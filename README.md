## Projects

As part of my master's thesis, I analyzed differences in the phosphoproteome of kidneys from healthy mice and those with acute kidney injury. After preprocessing the raw data, I generated a volcano plot to highlight the most significant differences and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and enrichment analysis.

The goal of this project was to gain experience with neural network implementation using PyTorch. I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, I tested the model on various internet-sourced images to see if the model could label them correctly.

This is a personal project intended to apply the knowledge I acquired from Google's Machine Learning Crash Course. The project consists of a logistic regression model that can detect peaks in the relative humidity signal of a room in real time.
