  <h3><a href="https://github.com/alexhumenyuk/Masters-Thesis-proteomics-AKI">Phosphoproteome Characterization of Acute Kidney Injury</a></h3>
  <p>
    As part of my master's thesis, I analyzed differences in the phosphoproteome of kidneys from healthy mice and those with acute kidney injury. After preprocessing the raw data, I generated a volcano plot to highlight the most significant differences and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and enrichment analysis.
