  <h3><a href="https://github.com/alexhumenyuk/Masters-Thesis-proteomics-AKI">Phosphoproteome Characterization of Acute Kidney Injury</a></h3>
  <p>
    As part of my master's thesis, I analyzed the differences between the phosphoproteome of kidneys from healthy mice and mice with acute kidney injury. After preprocessing the raw data, I generated a volcano plot to visualize the most significant differences and performed PCA and enrichment analysis.
