## Projects

![Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](/Images/kidneys.jpg "Optional hover text")  
**[Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](https://github.com/YourUser/Customer-Survival-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction)**  
In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time.  
I also implemented a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using a Flask webapp on Heroku.

  <strong><a href="https://github.com/alexhumenyuk/Masters-Thesis-proteomics-AKI">Phosphoproteome Characterization of Acute Kidney Injury</a></strong>
  <p>
    As part of my master's thesis, I analyzed differences in the phosphoproteome of kidneys from healthy mice and those with acute kidney injury. After preprocessing the raw data, I generated a volcano plot to highlight the most significant differences and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and enrichment analysis.

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/alexhumenyuk/Masters-Thesis-proteomics-AKI">Time-Frequency Analysis of Biomedical Signals</a></h3>
  <p>
    In this project I preprocessed and analyzed different biomedical signals, including repiratory flow, electromyogram (EMG), .

  <strong><a href="https://github.com/alexhumenyuk/AI-projects/tree/main/CIFAR10%20PyTorch%20project">CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch</a></strong>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to gain experience with neural network implementation using PyTorch. I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, I tested the model on various internet-sourced images to see if the model could label them correctly.
